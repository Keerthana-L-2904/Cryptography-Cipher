# Cryptography-Cipher
Converts cipher code to plain text and viceversa
Modules used are-
    1.	onetimepad Module:
        o	Description: This module is used for implementing the One-Time Pad encryption method. It is a simple yet theoretically unbreakable encryption technique.
        o	Usage in Project: The onetimepad module is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. The functions onetimepad.encrypt() and onetimepad.decrypt() are utilized to convert plain text to cipher text and vice versa.
    2.	tkinter Module:
        o	Description: tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It provides tools to create windows, dialogs, and various UI components.
        o	Usage in Project: The tkinter module is used to create the graphical interface of the cryptography cipher converter application. Components such as Tk(), Label, Entry, and Button are used to construct the interface and handle user interactions.
Tech Stack 
    1.	Python:
        o	Description: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
        o	Usage in Project: The entire project is implemented in Python, leveraging its libraries and modules to handle encryption and GUI development.
    2.	Tkinter:
        o	Description: As mentioned, tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. It provides a simple way to create graphical user interfaces.
        o	Usage in Project: tkinter is used to create and manage the user interface. This includes creating windows, labels, text entry fields, and buttons to interact with the user.
    3.	One-Time Pad Encryption:
        o	Description: One-Time Pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that uses a single-use pre-shared key the same length as the message being sent. It is theoretically unbreakable if the key is truly random and kept secret.
        o	Usage in Project: The project uses the onetimepad Python module to perform encryption and decryption. The OTP algorithm ensures that the plain text is converted to cipher text securely, and vice versa.
