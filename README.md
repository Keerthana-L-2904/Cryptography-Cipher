# Cryptography-Cipher
Converts cipher code to plain text and viceversa
Modules used are-
    1.	onetimepad Module: It is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. The functions onetimepad.encrypt() and onetimepad.decrypt() are utilized to convert plain text to cipher text and vice versa.
    2.	tkinter Module: The tkinter module is used to create the graphical interface of the cryptography cipher converter application. Components such as Tk(), Label, Entry, and Button are used to construct the interface and handle user interactions.
Tech Stack 
    1.	Python
    2.	One-Time Pad Encryption: The project uses the onetimepad Python module to perform encryption and decryption. The OTP algorithm ensures that the plain text is converted to cipher text securely, and vice versa.
